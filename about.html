		    <p>Bryan does the hard work, the long-shot work, the underdog work that topples the well-established and disrupts the status quo. He led Illinois' housing finance authority to be upgraded when peer state agencies were downgraded to junk; he ran successful bootstrapped political campaigns against the machine, and he recently helped his wife open Chicago’s first medical cannabis dispensary – the #1 Dispensary in Illinois in sales and in patient count since the day it opened. Bryan holds a bachelors degree in political science from the University of Chicago, a masters degree in film from the University of Southern California and a black belt in judo – where quite literally the bigger they are, the harder they fall.</p>
        <p>Bryan does not change opinion; he changes how people think.</p>
