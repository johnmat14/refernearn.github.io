When Chicago’s Chinatown business leaders wanted to support the City’s Olympic bid in a way that leveraged their relationships with Beijing, they asked Zises Communications to conceive, coordinate and guide a delegation of 40 people led by seven Chicago Alderman to Beijing, China, on the one-year anniversary of the 2008 Olympic Games.

Zises Communications handled all public relations, media relations, political affairs (we were guests of the Beijing Municipal Government) event management, logistics, and also wrote a comprehensive strategy report on behalf of the Aldermanic research delegation based on extensive interviews, tours, meetings and research.
