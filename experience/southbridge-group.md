Latin America’s premiere business outsourcing firm grew from a two-man shop to more than 200 dedicated employees serving clients across dozens of countries.

With Zises Communications as their strategy and marketing firm, Southbridge Group/Puente Sur doesn’t just compete against all the major international accounting firms — they thrive against them.  They dominate their geography with a comprehensive strategic approach that highlights their personal commitment and investment to their customers’ business.

The ‘big-six’ competition is deep-six’d.
