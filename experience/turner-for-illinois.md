Win, of course. That is what elections are about. But if you don’t win, make sure to lose on your own best terms.

Deputy Majority Leader Art Turner, a 30-year veteran legislator, was virtually unknown when he entered the democratic primary for Lt. Gov of Illinois against a millionaire who spent more than $2m. With less than 5% of his opponents’ resources, he ran a campaign for the long term.

Art Turner is now a household name, lauded for his honesty and integrity, a recognized thought-leader and is positioned to be a significant influencer of future elections for years to come. It is an important example of how losing can actually be a winning move.
